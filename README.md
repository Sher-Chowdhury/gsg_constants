Values for constants can only be set during compile time, not run time. Hence constant values are baked into the binary executable. 


```bash
$ go get github.com/Sher-Chowdhury/gsg_constants
$ go run github.com/Sher-Chowdhury/gsg_constants
hello world
```

also: 

```bash
$ export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin/
$ gsg_constants
